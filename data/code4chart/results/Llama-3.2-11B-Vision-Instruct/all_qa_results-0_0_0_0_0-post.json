The y-axis represents the frequency of each score, and the x-axis lists the countries and regions. \n\nTo calculate the mean, we need to sum up all the scores and divide by the total number of scores. \n\nFrom the chart, we can see that the scores range from 0 to 30, with most scores clustered around the lower end of the scale. \n\nLet's assume the sum of all the scores is S and the total number of scores is N. \n\nThe mean happiness score would be S/N. \n\nSince we don't have the exact values of S and N from the chart, we cannot calculate the exact mean. However, based on the options provided, we can make an educated guess. \n\nOption B (2.85) seems like a reasonable estimate",
