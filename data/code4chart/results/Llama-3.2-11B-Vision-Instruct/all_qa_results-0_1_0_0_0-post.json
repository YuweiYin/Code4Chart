The mean is calculated by summing all the values and dividing by the number of values.\n\nFrom the information given:\n\n- The minimum happiness score is 2.85.\n- The maximum happiness score is 7.77.\n- The standard deviation (std) of the happiness scores is 1.11.\n\nThe mean (\u03bc) can be calculated using the formula: \u03bc = (max + min) / 2, since the distribution is symmetric around the mean in this case.\n\n\u03bc = (2.85 + 7.77) / 2 = 5.41\n\nTherefore, the mean happiness score across different countries and regions is 5.41.\n\n*Answer*: C",
